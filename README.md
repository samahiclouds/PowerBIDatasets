Van Arsdel is a company that sells specialty bikes, the CMO asked to build a dashboard to analyze Van Arsdelâ€™s sales performance vs. top competitors and answer the following questions:
1.	What is VanArsdel's share of sales worldwide and highlight the US, and Australia?
2.	What is VanArsdel's share of sales in the Urban category?
3.	What is the revenue by country since 2014?
4.	What are the top 10 products by total revenue?
I have uploaded two additional files, the First is a docs file highlighting the process of producing the dashboard, from acquiring the data up to the production of the dashboard visuals, and the Second is the visuals file which is been exported as a PDF file.
